The script is pretty bare-bones and breaks a lot of Unix conventions.

To use: 
  1) edit "AutoStar.sh" and add your usename and password.
  2) Edit the "User to Star goes here" to have the name of the user you'd like to star
  3) Set the script on a timer. I used Lingon (http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/files/) to administer mine.
  
This is a bare-bones, barely works solution. I'll be contributing updates off and on.
